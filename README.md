# Java NLU Tools
Java tools to do natural language processing like NER and intent classification on short sentences.  
These tools provide an abstraction layer to [MALLET: A Machine Learning for Language Toolkit](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/) (Common Public License) and [Apache OpenNLP](https://opennlp.apache.org/) (Apache License Version 2.0). Stanford CoreNLP is supported as well but due to their GPL license it is implemented as [plugin](https://github.com/fquirin/java-nlu-tools-corenlp).
